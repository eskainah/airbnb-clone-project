# airbnb-clone-project

# Project Objective
The backend is designed to replicate Airbnb's core functionality—handling user management, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews—through a scalable, secure architecture.

# Project Goals
User Management: Secure registration, login, and profile management.
Property Management: CRUD operations for listings.
Booking System: Bookings with check-in/out details.
Payment Processing: Handle and log transactions.
Review System: Users can leave ratings and feedback.
Data Optimization: Indexing and caching for performance.

# Technology Stack
Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
Redis: Used for caching and session management.
Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

# Team Roles
Backend Developer: Implements logic and endpoints.
DB Admin: Manages schema and performance.
DevOps: Oversees deployment and scalability.
QA Engineer: Ensures reliability and correctness.

* `booking_id`: Associated booking
* `amount`: Total amount paid
* `status`: Payment status (e.g., pending, completed, failed)

* A **user** indirectly relates to a payment via a booking

**Review**
Captures feedback from users about properties.

**Key Fields:**
* `id`: Unique identifier for the review
* `user_id`: Reviewer (guest)

# API Security
*** Authentication
Implementation: Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT or DRF TokenAuth).

*** Authorization
Implementation: Role-based access control (RBAC) to distinguish permissions (e.g., host vs. guest).

*** Input Validation & Sanitization
Implementation: Django’s built-in validators and serializers.

*** Secure Payment Integration
Implementation: Use third-party gateways (e.g., Stripe) via secure APIs.

*** Session & Token Security
Implementation: Short-lived access tokens, refresh tokens, secure cookies, and CSRF protection.

*** Logging & Monitoring
Implementation: Audit logs for key actions, security alerts, and anomaly detection.

*** Database Security
Implementation: Role-based DB access, parameterized queries, regular backups.

| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User Data**           | To protect personal information like emails, names, and passwords from breaches. |
| **Payments**            | To ensure financial information is secure and prevent fraud or theft.            |
| **Bookings**            | To protect private travel plans and property availability from tampering.        |
| **Properties**          | To prevent unauthorized changes to listings and false property postings.         |
| **Reviews**             | To maintain platform integrity and avoid spam or malicious content.              |
| **System Availability** | To ensure reliable uptime and prevent abuse or overload from malicious actors.   |
