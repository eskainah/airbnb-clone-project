# Feature Breakdown
**User Management**
Handles registration, authentication, and profile updates for users through endpoints like `/users/`.
This feature ensures secure access and allows both guests and hosts to manage their personal and account-related information effectively.

**Property Management**
Manages creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of property listings via endpoints such as `/properties/`.
It enables hosts to list accommodations and keep property details current, forming the core of the platform's marketplace functionality.

**Booking System**
Facilitates booking operations through endpoints like `/bookings/`, allowing users to reserve properties and manage details like check-in/check-out.
This feature ensures smooth coordination between guests and hosts, supporting the transactional flow of the platform.

**Payment Processing**
Processes booking payments through the `/payments/` endpoint, recording transaction details securely.
It supports a critical part of the platform’s business logic, enabling financial transactions between users and the platform.

**Review System**
Lets users post, view, and manage property reviews using endpoints such as `/reviews/`.
This builds trust within the community by enabling feedback and ratings, helping future users make informed decisions.

**Data Optimization**
Implements database indexing and caching strategies to improve performance and scalability.
Efficient data retrieval and reduced load times ensure a smooth and responsive user experience, especially under high traffic.

**API Documentation**
Uses OpenAPI, Django REST Framework, and GraphQL for clearly structured and flexible API access.
This facilitates easy integration for frontend teams and third-party developers, speeding up development and ensuring maintainability.


# API Security
**Authentication**
Implementation: Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT or DRF TokenAuth).

**Authorization**
Implementation: Role-based access control (RBAC) to distinguish permissions (e.g., host vs. guest).

**Input Validation & Sanitization**
Implementation: Django’s built-in validators and serializers.

**Secure Payment Integration**
Implementation: Use third-party gateways (e.g., Stripe) via secure APIs.

*** Session & Token Security**
Implementation: Short-lived access tokens, refresh tokens, secure cookies, and CSRF protection.

*** Logging & Monitoring**
Implementation: Audit logs for key actions, security alerts, and anomaly detection.

*** Database Security**
Implementation: Role-based DB access, parameterized queries, regular backups.

| **User Data**           | To protect personal information like emails, names, and passwords from breaches. |
| **Payments**            | To ensure financial information is secure and prevent fraud or theft.            |
| **Bookings**            | To protect private travel plans and property availability from tampering.        |
| **Properties**          | To prevent unauthorized changes to listings and false property postings.         |
| **Reviews**             | To maintain platform integrity and avoid spam or malicious content.              |
| **System Availability** | To ensure reliable uptime and prevent abuse or overload from malicious actors.   |
